# Mood-Tracker
Mood Tracker is a simple Solidity smart contract that basically implements inheritance and an interface. This can be useful in cases where people need to track their moods due to some mental health issues or simply keep a record of when and how their moods changed and how often do they experience mood swings. The first commit is a very basic implementation of the same idea which can be scaled to add notes along with changing moods, which can better help an individual go back in time and realise what might have triggered a particular situation for their mental health. This also has a use case for psychologists, who can ask their patients to use this app which will help them analyse their patients' situation better, without having to rely solely on word of mouth by patients.
